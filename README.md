# python-siren-daemon
This is a small script to help protect your laptop when you leave your laptop unattended in a public workspace like a library. It is a daemon that plays a loud sound when the laptop is unplugged from the power source - hoping to create an embarrasing situation for the thief. 

It is quite simple to use just run main.py and the script will monitor if the laptop was unplugged from charging - and will play the file 'siren.mp3' when unplugged. You can put any other sound file instead of the provided 'siren.mp3' by just replacing the file with any other mp3. 

I am wondering if having the laptop call you text or you when it is unattended is a good idea?
